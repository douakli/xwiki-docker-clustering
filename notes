First try: Downlaod the war in $CATALINA_HOME/webapps. Letting tomcat unpack it.
Had to look at the log files in the container and see that we had a `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/servlet/ServletContextListener` error.
By googling the issue, we determined that the tomcat version we used was not compatible with XWiki.
We will now follow XWiki's Tomcat documentation: https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Installation/InstallationWAR/InstallationTomcat/

For XWiki to run, it needs to be configured.
Two notable things: https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Configuration/#HConfiguringDirectories => Need to set a permanent storage (docker volume)
And configuring the database: https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Documentation/AdminGuide/Installation/InstallationWAR/InstallationMariaDB/ is done through a file.
This is usually done through environment variables in docker images though.

One thing, the xwiki.properties configuration file is an important configuration file. We need to provide some defaults, but ultimately, the administrator might
want to change things in there. The correct approach would be to provide a default here and feed it into the container at runtime. That way, the user can make changes
to it.

Because we need the project to work out of the box, and there are many configuration files, we will initaliaze the project with good default, and move it into a use controlled
volume, where they can adjust details of their own.

We also need to inject the jdbc connector. Let's try to see if we can do this through a symlink.
